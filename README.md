# End-Term Submission ‚Äì CS Concepts and Problem Solving

## Overview
This repository is my weekly progress under the mid-term evaluation, with an emphasis on revising and solidifying basic computer science concepts and problem-solving with C++.

## Weekly Summary

### Week 0: CS101 Revision and STL Practice
- Revised major concepts of the CS101 course.
- Practiced Standard Template Library (STL) elements not previously covered in depth, including `map`, `unordered_map`, and other associative containers.

### Week 1: Linked Lists and Sorting Algorithms
- Learned and implemented simple sorting algorithms.
- Learned about singly and doubly linked list data structures and operations.

### Week 2: Heap, Queue, and Stack
- 
Implemented stack and queue using arrays and linked lists.
- Implemented min-heaps and max-heaps and solved priority queue-related problems.

### Week 3: Introduction to Dynamic Programming
- Started learning dynamic programming concepts.
- Emphasized recursive problem-solving, memoization, and pattern recognition to efficiently solve follow-up problems.
- 
### üóÇÔ∏è Week 4: Binary Trees and BST
- Studied binary tree fundamentals:
  - Traversals: Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, Level Order.
- Implemented problems:
  - Tree height, diameter, mirroring trees.
- Built trees from traversal arrays.
- Implemented core BST operations:
  - Insertion, search, and deletion.
- Solved:
  - Kth smallest/largest element, LCA, BST to Linked List.
- Understood BST vs balanced BST (AVL, Red-Black Trees).

### üóÇÔ∏è Week 6: Graphs and Traversal Algorithms
- Learned graph representation:
  - Adjacency List and Matrix.
- Implemented:
  - BFS and DFS.
- Solved problems like:
  - Cycle detection, bipartite graph check, connected components.
