# Mid-Term Submission â€“ CS Concepts and Problem Solving

## Overview
This repository is my weekly progress under the mid-term evaluation, with an emphasis on revising and solidifying basic computer science concepts and problem-solving with C++.

## Weekly Summary

### Week 0: CS101 Revision and STL Practice
- Revised major concepts of the CS101 course.
- Practiced Standard Template Library (STL) elements not previously covered in depth, including `map`, `unordered_map`, and other associative containers.

### Week 1: Linked Lists and Sorting Algorithms
- Learned and implemented simple sorting algorithms.
- Learned about singly and doubly linked list data structures and operations.

### Week 2: Heap, Queue, and Stack
- 
Implemented stack and queue using arrays and linked lists.
- Implemented min-heaps and max-heaps and solved priority queue-related problems.

### Week 3: Introduction to Dynamic Programming
- Started learning dynamic programming concepts.
- Emphasized recursive problem-solving, memoization, and pattern recognition to efficiently solve follow-up problems.

## Repository Structure
The repository is structured by week:
- `Week-0`: CS101 and STL
- `Week-1`: Sorting and Linked List
- `Week-2`: Stack, Queue, and Heap
- `Week-3`: Dynamic Programming

Each folder contains corresponding code files and solutions.
